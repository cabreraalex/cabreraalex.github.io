  I am a first year PhD student in the
  <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/">
    Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)
  </a>
  at
  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My research focus is broadly
  <b>human-centered AI</b>, 
  specifically in applying techniques from
  <b>HCI</b>
  and
  <b>visualization</b>
  to help people better understand and develop machine learning models.
  I am supported by a
  <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">
    NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.

  Before CMU, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from
  <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>, 
  where I was a member of the
  <a href="https://poloclub.github.io/">Polo Club of Data Science</a>
  and worked with
  <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/">Polo Chau</a>
  and

  I also spent a few summers as a software engineering intern at
