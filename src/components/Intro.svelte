  I am a PhD student in the
  <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/">
    Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)
  </a>
  at
  <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University,</a>
  advised by
  <a href="http://perer.org">Adam Perer</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jasonh/">Jason Hong.</a>
</p>

<p>
  My research focus is broadly
  <b>human-centered AI,</b>
  specifically in applying techniques from
  <b>HCI</b>
  and
  <b>visualization</b>
  to help people develop machine learning models that are better aligned with
  human values. I am supported by a
  <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.</a>
</p>

<p>
  Before CMU, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from
  <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech,</a>
  where I worked with
  <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/">Polo Chau</a>
  and
  <a href="http://jamiemorgenstern.com/">Jamie Morgenstern.</a>
  I also spent a few summers as a software engineering intern at
